# Trello Like Application

This Trello-Like application is orginaly made for a test technique but it turned out finally into a side-project !

I used the following technologies:

- Rails
- VueJs
- Bootstrap
- PostgreSQL
- Gem Acts_as_list
- Gem Draggable

I've used Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

# README

This is a Todo App musing Vue.js 3 and Rails 6.1.3.2.

# Local Development

## Installation

### Prerequisites

If you don't already have them :

- Install ruby 2.7.3 `rbenv install 2.7.3 && rbenv global 2.7.3`
- Install bundler 2.2.15 `gem install bundler:2.2.15`
- Install yarn `npm i -g yarn`

### Set up the repo

To install dependencies, run :

```bash
bundle install
yarn
```

To set up database, run:

```bash
rails db:setup
```

When running the `db:setup` command, the Database test and development will be created.
The User email and password to connect to the App will be display in the console and the seeds will be create.

### Set environment variables

Running the app locally requires 3 environment variables. To set up your environment variables, run the following command:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Then, edit `.env` and set the following environment variables:

- `REDIS_DB`: This is Redis_db
- `REDIS_URL`: This is Redis URL
- `REDIS_PORT`: This is Redis Port

For more information, you can read "[ruby on rails redis installation and configuration](https://hixonrails.com/ruby-on-rails-tutorials/ruby-on-rails-redis-installation-and-configuration/)"
Or refer to the [Redis](documentation)

### Database / Cache

1. Create a database called `Todo_development` using your favorite postgresql GUI or CLI.
2. Then run the migrations : `bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development`

### Start the server

To start both the frontend and backend servers at the same time, run:

```bash
bin/rails s
bin/webpack-dev-server
```

In your browser, navigate to localhost:3000 to see the app in action!

This may be helpful for debugging, but generally should not be necessary.
