# Trello Like Application

This Trello-Like application is orginaly made for a test technique but it turned out finally into a side-project !

I used the following technologies:
- Rails
- VueJs
- Bootstrap
- Gem Acts_as_list
- Gem Draggrable

I've used Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
